uwsgi is an app that runs on the web server -nginx- and it serves the python app -django app-
but i think it can serve others things too, other than only what the apps needs..?
uwsgi    -> wsgi for nginx
mod_wsgi -> wsgi for apache
wsgi = web server gateway inteface / specifications for python apps... thas's cool

the client is a process, just like the the services

the client and the server comunicates over the request-response model.
For what i understand, HTTP carries this request-response thing

Hosts are like the app that the clients want to deal with and tha the server serves, right?
One host computer can have multiple host names, but we preffer to use one

Url indicate: the protocol/hostname/especifications -based on what the client needs or wants from the app-

==== NginX ====
nginx installation folder: /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.21.1
configurations: /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -port and stuff-
nginx will load all files in: /usr/localetc/nginx/servers/

it has one master process and several worker processes 
configuarion is in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
worker processes do the actual work. The master one only manages things

Employs event-based model to distribute requests among worker processes
nginx -s {signal} -> sends signals to the master process
signals = {stop, quit, reload, reopen}
The master process starts the work process

It looks like these processes are just normal system processes that are used by nginx

nginx.pid -> /usr/loca/var/run/nginx/nginx.pid

nginx is controlled by directives, which are in the nginx.conf
Ex:
  http{
    sendfile  on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
  }
This is how you control the master process, these are like instructions to the master process
block directive ->  http {}

==============

the services that start with the operting system are at /Libary/LaunchAgents
