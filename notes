uwsgi is an app that runs on the web server -nginx- and it serves the python app -django app-
but i think it can serve others things too, other than only what the apps needs..?
uwsgi    -> wsgi for nginx
mod_wsgi -> wsgi for apache
wsgi = web server gateway inteface / specifications for python apps... thas's cool

the client is a process, just like the the services

the client and the server comunicates over the request-response model.
For what i understand, HTTP carries this request-response thing

Hosts are like the app that the clients want to deal with and tha the server serves, right?
One host computer can have multiple host names, but we preffer to use one

Url indicate: the protocol/hostname/especifications -based on what the client needs or wants from the app-

nginx installation folder: /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.21.1
configurations: /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -port and stuff-
nginx will load all files in: /usr/localetc/nginx/servers/

the services that start with the operting system are at /Libary/LaunchAgents
